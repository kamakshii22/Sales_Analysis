# Sales Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis project repository! This project aims to provide valuable insights into sales trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics, facilitating data-driven decision-making for business optimization. Below is an overview of the project structure, methodologies employed, and key insights derived.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making. By exploring sales data over time and across different regions, stakeholders can gain valuable insights to optimize sales strategies and drive business growth.

## Project Overview
This project consists of three main phases: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, Data Analysis, and Visualization. Here's a brief overview of each phase:

### 1. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process
- **Extract (E):** Imported CSV file into a SQL database table named `sales_data`.
- **Transform (T):** Renamed columns, split `Order Date` into separate date and time columns, and prepared the data for analysis.
- **Load (L):** Loaded transformed data into Power BI for visualization and further analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis
- Identified top-selling products, analyzed total sales for each city, and calculated revenue metrics such as total revenue and profit margins.
- Explored sales trends over time to understand seasonal variations and fluctuations in sales performance.

### 3. Visualization
- Utilized various visualizations including line charts, tree maps, stacked bar charts, and map visualizations to present key insights effectively.
- Implemented interactive features such as slicers for dynamic data exploration and filtering.

## Insights
- **Sales Trends Over Time:** Identified seasonal patterns and fluctuations in sales performance over time.
- **Top-Selling Products:** Highlighted key products contributing significantly to revenue generation.
